# 📊 Data Analysis and Visualisation – Recruitment Fairness Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on building a predictive and interpretable machine learning pipeline for recruitment data. Using a dataset of job applicants, the aim was to explore patterns, build classification models, and evaluate fairness to ensure ethical AI-driven hiring decisions.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore applicant data through feature engineering and pattern discovery  
- Build classification models to predict hiring outcomes  
- Apply **explainability methods** (SHAP, LIME) for transparency  
- Test models for **fairness** (group & individual metrics)  

---

## 🛠 Methods & Techniques  

### 🔹 Data Preparation  
- Discretization and feature engineering (e.g., referee alignment & diversity)  

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning  
- K-Medoids clustering to uncover subgroup hiring patterns  

### 🔹 Association Rule Mining  
- Apriori algorithm for identifying hiring-related rules  

### 🔹 Supervised Learning  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Bagging  
- AdaBoost  
- **XGBoost** (best performing, ~98% accuracy)  

### 🔹 Explainability  
- **SHAP** → global feature importance  
- **LIME** → local instance-level explanations  

### 🔹 Fairness Testing  
- Group fairness (gender, age, university background)  
- Individual fairness (similarity-based consistency)

## 📈 Key Findings  
- **Academic performance** (A-levels) strongly influenced hiring outcomes  
- **Referees** (quality, diversity, alignment) had measurable effects, raising fairness concerns  
- **XGBoost** outperformed other classifiers with strong predictive accuracy and generalisation  
- **Fairness analysis** showed high individual fairness but potential bias towards elite universities

## 💡 Reflections  
This project demonstrates how advanced machine learning techniques can be integrated with ethical considerations such as fairness and interpretability. By combining predictive performance with fairness analysis, it offers a blueprint for responsible AI in recruitment systems.
